## Description

> Challenge #6 Weather Dashboard

## Introduction 
We are to create a weather dashboard using a server side API. This will allow users to enter in a city name and show the current weather for that city as well as the 5 day forecast. You will also be able to see the previous cities you have searched.

## Challenges

I had to set this challenge aside a long time ago. This was the challenge that was due right before our project 1 so i decided to skip it for now and come back to it when i had time. Coming back to old code was tricky for me to re-grasp a language that i hadnt really dominately used in months. I mixed some vanilla javascript with some jquery as well just because i sometimes forget which language im pulling knowledge from.

## Victories

I was able to sit down and come back to a few bugs that i had walked away from some weeks ago. I has having a hard time getting my search content containers to empty out for new searches to come in. I was also struggling to get the local storage to populate correctly but both issues i did resolve. I'm glad im able to turn it in now instead of having no grade, but i would like try and polish it up a little bit more style wise.
